# Pictures-and-Pixels
An application built using Java and Java Swing that allows users to modify a pre-loaded image in different ways similar to MS Paint. 

# Motivation
This was the final project for my Foundations of Programming course.

# Features
Users can choose between a Pixel Inspector, Paintbrush, and a Blur Tool. 
  The Pixel Inspector allows the user to click on any pixel in the image and it will show its location in X,Y coordinates and will show the RGB color value of that pixel. 
  The Paintbrush tool allows the user to color over the image in brushes of different colors and sizes. The brush also allows the user to change the opacity of the color. 
  The Blur tool allows the user to blur the image using brushes of different sizes. Blurring is done by calculating the average color of a certain region of pixels and recoloring that region. 

# Installation
This project requires Java 1.8 or higher. It can be cloned into and ran from any IDE of your choice.
